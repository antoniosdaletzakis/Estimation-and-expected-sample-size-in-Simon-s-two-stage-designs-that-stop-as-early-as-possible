# Estimation and expected sample size in Simon's two-stage designs that stop as early as possible

This repository is about our research work in the Simon's two-stage design in the case of early stopping due to efficacy or futility, given that the design requirements has already being met. This paper has already been published in 22 FEB 2022 in Pharmaceutical statistics journal: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pst.2200
It contains: 
1) The code that the data were simulated is included as well as the way that the graphs where produced.
2) The supplementary matterial code used, included in the main code. 

We calculated a new estimate that is the Uniform minimum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE) about the specific methodologic question.
